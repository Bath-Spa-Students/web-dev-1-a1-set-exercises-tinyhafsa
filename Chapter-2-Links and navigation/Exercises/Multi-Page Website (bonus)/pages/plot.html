            <p class="quote">〝 The end of Earth will not be the end of us. 〞</p>
            <p>Earth, 2067. With widespread famine ravaging humankind and unprecedented blight collapsing the global economies, Joseph Cooper, a reclusive farmer and father of two, becomes NASA's last hope. As a result, a team of researchers determined to find answers in the vastness of space embarks on a life-and-death mission to discover a compatible new home for the now-endangered human race. But as Cooper leaves his family behind in search of opportunities, unfathomable mysteries unfold, and a crucial question arises. Are the bold extragalactic explorers prepared to push the limits of knowledge and interstellar travel? </p>

            <p class="quote2"><b>Cooper:</b> We've always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. But we lost all that. Or perhaps we've just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we've barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, that our destiny lies above us.</p>
