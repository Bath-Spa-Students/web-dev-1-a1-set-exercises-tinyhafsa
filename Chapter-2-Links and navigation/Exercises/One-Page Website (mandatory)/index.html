            <p>Earth, 2067. With widespread famine ravaging humankind and unprecedented blight collapsing the global economies, Joseph Cooper, a reclusive farmer and father of two, becomes NASA's last hope. As a result, a team of researchers determined to find answers in the vastness of space embarks on a life-and-death mission to discover a compatible new home for the now-endangered human race. But as Cooper leaves his family behind in search of opportunities, unfathomable mysteries unfold, and a crucial question arises. Are the bold extragalactic explorers prepared to push the limits of knowledge and interstellar travel? </p>

                <h4>Masterpiece</h4>
                <p class="user">aheaven2005 - 25 June 2022 <span class="stars">★★★★★</span></p>
                <p>A science-fiction masterpiece. Nolan executes a marvelous direction that slowly but efficiently puts in place a dark world creating a necessity to save humanity. Add to that great performances from Nolan and Hathaway plus a great score from Hans Zimmer. The result is on the best science-fiction movies of all time.</p>

                <p class="user">mysteryvoiceman - 24 June 2018 <span class="stars">★★★★★</span></p>
                <p>I hadn't seen this but movie and caught it on a flight back from the DR. One of my favorite movies of all time. I would give the first half of the movie an 11/10, just completely enjoyed it as a sci fi/ thriller(in the sense of so much always being on the line). I loved the acting and just yeah, a great movie and one you should go see if you never have</p>
